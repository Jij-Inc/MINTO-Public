    "\n",
    "1. You need a GitHub account and repository.\n",
    "2. If you haven't created one yet, refer to GitHub's documentation on repository creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To push to GitHub Packages, authentication using a Personal Access Token (PAT) or GITHUB_TOKEN is required in GitHub Actions. Create a PAT with write:packages permission.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the obtained token, authenticate using one of the following two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using CLI\n",
    "    Execute ommx login to save authentication information on your local machine\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    ommx login --username=<GITHUB_USERNAME> --password=<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> https://ghcr.io\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Using environment variables\n",
    "    - Set the following environment variables\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "    env:\n",
    "        OMMX_BASIC_AUTH_DOMAIN: ghcr.io\n",
    "        OMMX_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME: ${{ github.actor }}\n",
    "        OMMX_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD: ${{ github.token }}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For `OMMX_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`, you need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token. To create a Personal Access Token, follow GitHub's guide and enable the `write:packages` permission\n",
    "  \n",
    "Note: Push and pull to GitHub Packages uses the OMMX Artifact feature. Therefore, settings such as GitHub authentication are the same as OMMX Artifact. For details, refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/Jij-Inc/ommx/blob/main/notebooks/artifact.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### push\n",
    "\n",
    "Once authentication is set up, use the Experiment.push_github method to push to GitHub Packages.\n",
    "This method has the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- org: Organization name in GitHub\n",
    "- repo: GitHub repository name\n",
    "- name: Artifact name (default is `Experiment.name`)\n",
